<p align="center">Hyfetch / Neofetch clone written in Rust</p>

---

This project aims to become an alternative (but not a drop-in replacement) for popular fetching programs, such as neofetch, fastfetch, hyfetch and the like. However, for now it is in its infancy and in its current state it lacks a lot of funcionality. Here is a list of what is missing:

# TODO
- [ ] Logos
- [ ] Logo colors
- [x] Configuration
- [x] Command line arguments
- [ ] Icons / Custom mode
- [ ] Bottom colors
- [ ] Custom hostname header
- [ ] Custom footer
- [ ] Flag funcionality from Hyfetch
- [ ] UwU mode
- [ ] Caching fetch information
