<p align="center">Hyfetch / Neofetch clone written in Rust</p>

---

This project aims to become an alternative (but not a drop-in replacement) for popular fetching programs, such as neofetch, fastfetch, hyfetch and the like. However, for now it is in its infancy and in its current state it lacks a lot of funcionality. Here is a list of what is missing:

- [ ] Logos
- [x] Configuration
- [x] Command line arguments
- [ ] Flag funcionality from Hyfetch
- [ ] Caching fetch information
